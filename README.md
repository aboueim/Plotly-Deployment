# Belly Button BioDiversity Dashboard

## Project Description

In this project, I create an interactive dynamic dashboard including an dropdown to select IDs, a panel to display individuals' demographic infomration, a horizontal bar sorting the top 10 bacteria species in individuals' belly button identified by their unique IDs, a bubble chart presenting bacteria IDs against their sample values, and finally a gauge chart indicating the frequency of individuals washing their belly buttons. To enhance quality of dashboard, I also utlized several customizations such as embedding additional information, adding images, and differentiating colors.
